Platty the Party-Planning Platypus App
Utah State University CS 3450 - Software Engineering Team Project - Spring 2015

Tutorial I'm getting my info from:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/

First off, follow the tutorial to get Python and Django installed.

Then to start up the server and do stuff:
1) cd into the first platty and type (without the quotes):
    'python manage.py runserver'
2) Navigate to 'http://localhost:8000/signin/' to see the index page for the "signin" app
